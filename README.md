# liri-node-app
language version of SIRI, that looks up music, concert, and movie data

Problem Statement: We all need our entertainment information at my finger tips.  Thats why Liri, provides you with up to date movie, music, and concert information in the blink of an eye through the power of API calls.
Overview: Liri takes in 4 commands. 'concert-this', 'spotify-this-song', 'movie-this', and 'do-what-it-says' if your feeling lucky.  You follow up the anyone of the first three commands by naming an artist, a song title, or a movie title respectively.  For example 'concert-this' Kiss will give you information about KISS's next concert date.  'do-what-it-says' reads a random text file to give you a random spotify api return.
Instructions: In the terminal, navigate to the liri-node-app. Type in "node liri.js" then your command, then your search object.  For example "node liri.js spotify-this-song' Tonight Tonight.  Liri will then output the data for your selected track from the Spotify API.
